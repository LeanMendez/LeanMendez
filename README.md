<p>Hey there! My name is Leandro and I am a developer with a couple of years of experience. I am a curious person and love to keep learning new things. Additionally, I enjoy helping and teaching others. I used to be a math teacher and also studied Civil Engineering for a couple of years. In my free time, I like to play volleyball, PC games, and board games. I also enjoy building side projects. Here you will find a few of them</p>
